Meeting was done on Nov 30 (everyone participated) and this is what was discussed

Participants:
Ahmad Ghadban
Zoubair Hamid
Jessica Batta 
Sakshi Jagtap 

The Sprint Goal:

The sprint goal is to finish implementing the rest of the user stories (1.3, 1.4, 1.6) and to finish and practice the presentation together. In addition, finish all documents required. 

User Stories Decisions: 

Once we reached sprint 2 we had a firm understanding of what we needed to do and so there was no need to add/delete or change any of the user stories. All 6 were implemented as intended at the end of sprint 1. 

Team Capacity:

We expect to have the last 3 user stories completed and all required documents updated (designPatterns.pdf and productBacklog.csv) We also expect to finish all new documents required (codeReviews.csv, finalproductBacklog.csv, sprint1.md, SR1.md and standups). As well as finishing the presentation with adequate practice.

Task Breakdown:

We decided to evenly split the tasks again giving everyone at least one task to do per the rubric. Sakshi will do SR2.md, Ahmad will do sprint2.md and user story 1.4, Zoubair will do user story 1.3 while overseeing codeReviews.csv, and lastly Jessica will do user story 1.6 while overseeing standups. This way everyone has a specific task assigned to them. Then the whole group will work together on completing the presentation slideshow to ensure an even split in everyone's work, and ensure everyone has at least one task.
