Meeting was done on Nov 22 (everyone participated) and this is what was discussed

Participants:
Ahmad Ghadban
Zoubair Hamid
Jessica Batta 
Sakshi Jagtap 

The Sprint Goal:

The sprint goal is to implement 3 user stories 1.2, 1.5 and 1.7 and also fix the bug 1.1 while splitting the rest of the work evenly between the group. 

User Stories Decisions: 
We have decided to not do 1.3 and 1.4 as 1.2 is a blocker for both. This is why we decided that 1.2 should be implemented in this sprint to set up for user stories 1.3 and 1.4 in the next sprint. We then decided that the implementation of 1.5 and 1.7 should be finished by this sprint. The reason 1.6 was not completed is due to the owner working on user story 1.7 first, and the owner is still selecting the icons.

There was also a change in the user story 1.5 it can also give users options to which move they want to undo. The reason is because we wanted to give the user options to select which move they want to undo and revert the code back to that move. 

Team Capacity:
We expect to have 3 user stories completed and all required documents updated (designPatterns.pdf and productBacklog.csv) We also expect to finish all new documents required (codeReviews.csv, sprint1.md, SR1.md and standups) The reason only 3 user stories are expected is outlined above.

Task Breakdown:
We decided to break down the tasks as evenly as possible. Ahmad will do sprint1.md, Sakshi will do SR1.md. The rest of the documents require the whole group to edit so we put Zoubair in charge of codeReviews.csv and featureWork while Jessica is in charge of desginPatterns.pdf, productBacklog.csv and standups. What it means is they will be responsible to make sure everyone has finished it and pushed it. Including that everyone will be responsible for their user story.
